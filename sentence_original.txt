an elderly heron made his home in a pond ful of fish.
He was stiff
he was slow in his old age
he didn't find it easy to catch his lunch.
However, he decided to use his wits
he went to see a crab
a great chatterbox
and in a mock frightened voice
told him the latest rumour.
Certain birds are my friends
coming here soon with their nets.
They're going to take away all the fish.
I'll have no meals left.
Everything will be gone
the frying pan
The crab quickly scuttled away
to the banks of the pond
and dived in to
tell the fish the awful news.
The frightened fish begged the crab
returned to the heron.

to a pond hidden in the forest.
They'll be quite safe there.
But will the fish trust me

They unwrapped their sandwiches.
He took bread for breakfast.

He was ashamed of the grades

There was no emergency.

Hiking is a good exercise.
Hippopotamuses love water.

The ghost vanished suddenly.
The girl cried out for help.
The girl trembled with fear.
The goods arrived undamaged.

The island is warm all year.
The job is practically done.
The kids are finaly asleep.
The lid screws onto the jar.
The light suddenly went out.
The machine is out of order.
